# Classical-Statistical-Methods
Educating myself on and implementing classical (frequentist) statistical techniques.

I hope to learn and implement new inference methods at a rate of around 2 projects or notes/3 days, though this is an ambitious goal. However, given a solid background in probability and statistics (and passing familiarity with some of these methods), I hope to maintain a high rate of productivity.
